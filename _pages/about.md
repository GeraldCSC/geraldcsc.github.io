Welcome! I am a Research Scientist working on reinforcement learning at NVIDIA. I completed my HBSc at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) studying computer science, evolutionary and human biology. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to work with [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/marzyeh/) and [Sheldon Huang](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~huang/) on unsupervised out-of-distribution detection.

My research interests revolve around RL for LLMs, ranging from systems to algorithms. I am involved in post-training of [Nemotron](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03624v1) models and was the core developer of [NeMo-Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01481).
